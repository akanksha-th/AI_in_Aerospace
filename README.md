# Machine_Translation
In this repository, I explore neural machine translation using state-of-the-art models and techniques. This repository is organized into three levels of difficulty to showcase progressive learning and application:

## Projects Overview:
    ### Easiest Method (Hugging Face Models):
    Simple text translation using pre-trained models.

    ### Intermediate Project: Customized Neural Machine Translation
    Fine-tune models for specific domains like legal or medical texts.

    ### Hard Project: Multilingual Translation with Transfer Learning
    Develop a scalable system for diverse language pairs using transfer learning.
