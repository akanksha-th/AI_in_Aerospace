# Machine_Translation
In this repository, I explore neural machine translation using state-of-the-art models and techniques. This repository is organized into three levels of difficulty to showcase progressive learning and application:

## Projects Overview:
### Easiest Method:
- Hugging Face Models
- Simple text translation using pre-trained models.
- Deployment with Gradio.

### Intermediate Project (Level-1): 
- Customized Neural Machine Translation
- Fine-tune models for specific domains like legal or medical texts.
- Deployment with Streamlit.

### Intermediate Project (Level-2): 
- Multilingual Translation with Transfer Learning
- Develop a scalable system for diverse language pairs using transfer learning.
